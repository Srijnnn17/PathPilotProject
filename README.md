üöÄ PathPilot - Your AI-Powered Learning Navigator
PathPilot is a full-stack, AI-enhanced web platform that revolutionizes online learning. Instead of one-size-fits-all courses, PathPilot uses the power of Google's Gemini API to generate dynamic, on-the-fly skill assessments and crafts a truly personalized learning roadmap for every user.

This project was built to demonstrate a mastery of modern web development technologies, from a robust MERN stack backend to a sleek, responsive React frontend, all powered by a cutting-edge AI engine.



‚ú® Core Features
Dynamic AI Quiz Generation: Gone are the days of static questions. PathPilot uses the Google Gemini API to generate a unique, fresh set of 10 quiz questions in real-time, every time a user starts a skill assessment.

Secure User Authentication: A complete, secure authentication system built from the ground up with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) stored in httpOnly cookies.

Personalized Progress Dashboard: A clean, intuitive dashboard where users can track their quiz history, view scores, and monitor their learning journey.

Responsive & Modern UI: A beautiful, dark-themed user interface built with Tailwind CSS, designed to be fully responsive and visually stunning on any device.

Scalable MERN Stack Architecture: A well-organized, production-quality codebase featuring a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend with Redux Toolkit for state management.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
