# üöÄ PathPilot - Your AI-Powered Learning Navigator

-----

### ‚ñ∫ OVERVIEW

Welcome to PathPilot, a full-stack, AI-enhanced web platform that revolutionizes online learning. PathPilot scraps the inefficient one-size-fits-all model and instead uses the power of Google's Gemini API to generate dynamic, on-the-fly skill assessments. Based on your performance, it crafts a truly personalized learning roadmap, guiding you to mastery.

This project was built to demonstrate a mastery of modern web development technologies, from a robust MERN stack backend to a sleek, responsive React frontend, all powered by a cutting-edge AI engine.
